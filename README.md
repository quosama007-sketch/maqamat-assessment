## 📖 About

Based on the nine spiritual stations (maqāmāt) described in Imam al-Mawwāq's *Sunan al-Muhtadīn* (d. 897 AH), as explained by Sheikh Hamza Yusuf in his DEENSTREAM Turkey 2015 lectures.

The assessment helps Muslims understand their current spiritual station and provides guidance for ascending (taraqqi) to higher levels.

**All nine stations are within Islam and Paradise.**
